            <dt class="faq-question">What is GARO Ares?</dt>
            <dd class="faq-answer">Ares is GARO’s modular battery energy storage system (BESS). It combines a hybrid inverter and LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery in one system, with 1–6 battery packs for roughly 5–30 kWh usable capacity. It’s suitable for indoor or outdoor installation (IP65) and is aimed at homeowners and professional installers in the UK and Ireland.</dd>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt class="faq-question">Do I need solar panels to use Ares?</dt>
            <dd class="faq-answer">No. You can use Ares with or without solar. Without solar, you can charge from the grid (e.g. on off-peak tariffs) and use the stored energy when rates are higher. With solar, you can also store surplus generation and increase self-consumption.</dd>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt class="faq-question">Can Ares provide backup power during a power cut?</dt>
            <dd class="faq-answer">Yes. Ares has a backup output that can keep essential loads running during a grid outage. Switching to backup typically happens in under 10 ms. The amount of backup time depends on how many battery packs you have and what loads are connected.</dd>
