        <h1 class="page-section-title">What can you save? VAT & incentives in the UK and Ireland</h1>
        <p class="page-section-lead">Below is a simple overview of how VAT and some government schemes can help with the cost of a home battery or solar setup. Rules and amounts can change, and your situation may differ—so we always recommend checking the official links for the latest information.</p>

        <div class="incentives-block">
          <h2 class="incentives-country-title">United Kingdom</h2>
          <p class="incentives-teaser">You can benefit from 0% VAT on battery storage and, if you have solar, payments for exporting energy to the grid.</p>
          <h3 class="incentives-subtitle">What you can save or benefit from</h3>
          <ul class="incentives-list">
            <li><strong>0% VAT on home battery systems</strong> — You don’t pay VAT on the supply and installation of a battery storage system. That can mean a noticeable saving compared to the standard VAT rate (e.g. on a typical system this could be in the hundreds or more—exact amount depends on your installer and system).</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Export Guarantee (SEG)</strong> — If you have solar panels and export unused electricity to the grid, you can get paid for it. How much depends on the tariff you’re on. Details: <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEG on Ofgem’s website</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Other schemes</strong> — Depending on where you live, there may be local or national loans or grants. It’s worth checking <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gov.uk</a> or your local authority for current schemes.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="incentives-subtitle">Conditions to be aware of</h3>
          <ul class="incentives-list">
            <li>0% VAT applies to qualifying battery storage installations in the UK; your installer can confirm eligibility.</li>
            <li>SEG is for exporting solar electricity—you need solar panels and a compatible setup.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="incentives-block">
          <h2 class="incentives-country-title">Ireland</h2>
          <p class="incentives-teaser">You can benefit from 0% VAT when batteries are installed with solar, and from a grant towards solar panels (no separate grant for batteries alone).</p>
          <h3 class="incentives-subtitle">What you can save or benefit from</h3>
          <ul class="incentives-list">
            <li><strong>0% VAT on batteries when installed with solar</strong> — If you install a battery <em>together with</em> solar panels, the battery (and qualifying work) can be zero-rated for VAT, which reduces the overall cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar panel grant</strong> — You may be able to get a grant of up to €1,800 towards solar panel installation. There is no separate grant for a battery on its own. Full details and eligibility: <a href="https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/solar-electricity-grant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEAI Solar Electricity Grant</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="incentives-subtitle">Conditions to be aware of</h3>
          <ul class="incentives-list">
            <li>In Ireland, the 0% VAT treatment for batteries applies when they are installed <em>with</em> solar panels. If you install a battery only (no solar), different VAT rules may apply—check with your installer or revenue authority.</li>
            <li>The solar grant is subject to SEAI eligibility criteria and application process.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="incentives-summary">
          <h2 class="incentives-summary-title">Quick comparison</h2>
          <ul class="incentives-list">
            <li><strong>UK:</strong> 0% VAT on home battery systems (standalone or with solar). SEG payments if you export solar to the grid. No dedicated grant for batteries alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Ireland:</strong> 0% VAT on batteries when installed together with solar; grant of up to €1,800 for solar (no separate battery grant).</li>
            <li>In both countries, incentives and eligibility can change. Always confirm with official sources or your installer before making decisions.</li>
